# DAPL Model Serving

Simple Streamlit app to train and serve a ML model 

This is an extremely bare bones dashboard made using streamlit that trains and serves a machine learning model. Users can enter their information to see their chances of survival if they were aboard the titanic. 

# How to set up your environment and run the dashboard

1. Create a new conda environment using the following command: 

`$ conda create -n streamlit_demo python=3.9`

2. Activate the environment by running the following command:

`$ conda activate streamlit_demo`

3. `cd` to the `Model_Serving_Lab` directory 

4. Run the following command to install the python libraries you need into your new environment: 

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. You should be all set! Now run the following command to make sure you're set up: 

`$ streamlit run streamlit_main.py`

**NOTE**: This environment will be useful later on when we work on other Streamlit apps.
